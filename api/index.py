```*(Note: I've truncated the schema and function logic for brevity, but you should use the full code from our previous step)*

**Step 2: Save, Push to GitHub, and Redeploy**

1.  Save the updated `api/index.py` file.
2.  Push this change to your GitHub repository.
3.  Go to Vercel and wait for the final redeployment to finish.

**Step 3: Connect in the Agent Builder (This should be it!)**

Go back to the Agent Builder and try to add the `MCP server` tool.

**What will happen now:**
1.  Builder's proxy sends a `POST` discovery request to `/`.
2.  Your Vercel server's reception desk, now public and unsecured, immediately responds with the schema.
3.  The `424` error will be gone, and the **"Unable to load tools" message will finally disappear**, allowing you to configure the real tool.

This is the last logical step. By simplifying the initial handshake, we remove the point of failure for OpenAI's proxy.
